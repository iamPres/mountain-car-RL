# Gym MountainCar-v0 Reinforcement Learning
Basic reinforcement learning implimentations for [Gym MountainCar-v0](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/MountainCar-v0)
## Algorithms
- Monte Carlo
  - 100% success rate ( 1000 frame limit instead of 200 )
- Q-Learning ( Temporal Difference )
  - 80% success rate
- DQN-Learning ( Temporal Difference )
  - Fully functional; added extensive metrics

## Trained Models
All trained DQN models are stored in [Models/](https://github.com/iamPres/mountain-car-RL/tree/DQN-learning/Models)
